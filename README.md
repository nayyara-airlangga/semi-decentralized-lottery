# Lottery Smart Contract

## Overview

This is a semi-decentralized lottery system which is written and governed by an ethereum smart contract

## How It Works

1. Users can enter the lottery with ETH based on a USD fee
2. An admin can choose when to end the lottery (hence the semi part)
3. The lottery selects a random winner
